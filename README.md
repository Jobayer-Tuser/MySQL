### List of Constraints
```
[1] NOT NULL
    Not Null is define as Must be Required for a specific column as well.
[2] NULL
    Null is define as Not Required at all for a specific column as well. Beacause as many times 
    user didn't pass values without required fields and in other hand the null column will be doesn't care 
    about values is passed or not. To avoid any MySQL Bugs or Error it's mendatory to use.
[3] DEFAULT
[4] CHECK
[5] PRIMARY KEY	
    (a) Primary key always has unique data
    (b) A primary key cannot have null value
    (c) A table can contain only one primary key constraints
[6] FOREIGN KEY	
    (a) Foreign Key Column must allow NULL, and may put DEFAULT VALUE as NULL
    (b) Foreign key is used to link two tables together	
    (c) A foreign key in one table used to point primary key in another table	
    (d) Before creating RELATION remove unnecessary data from Foreign Key column	
    (e) Primary Key Column and Foreign Key Columnâ€™s structure and value type must be same	
[7] UNIQUE
```
